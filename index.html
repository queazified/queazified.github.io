            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there, welcome to my GitHub portfolio. My name is Andrey, also known as Queazified - a person who runs their own Home Lab and enjoys trying out and fixing new technology.</p>
            <p>- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my littlelink repo, which is like Linktree, a link that shows you all my social media, and other things, like my Spotify account, but is open source, unlike Linktree. I'm also working on other stuff, like my Home Lab, which helps me improve on my IT skills, aswell as helping to make my like just that little bit easier.</p>
            <p>- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Proxmox, a hypervisor that I now use, and TrueNAS, my new way to store files on my server. So far my SMB share is faster and more reliable than it was on Samba.</p>
            <p>- âš¡ Server specs: HP EliteDesk 800 G3 SFF with a CPU of Intel Core i5-7500, 24GB of DDR4 RAM and a GPU as the GT710 (2GB VRAM version), I would say this is not too beefy of a system, but not too weak. My old server however was the HP EliteDesk 800 G3 TWR, which is the same system, just bigger. I prefer the SFF model though, because of the size, and you get an M.2 slot, which the TWR model doesn't.</p>
